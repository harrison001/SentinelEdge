- Real-time behavior monitoring
- Security event detection
- Rule-based threat classification
- Educational value for systems programming
- Good architecture demonstration

---

## 📦 System Components

### 1. `kernel_agent` - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: eBPF Kernel Probe Module
> Used to capture critical kernel-level behavior events and output them to userspace daemon through ringbuffer.

**Features:**
- Network connection event collection (TCP/UDP)
- File operation event collection (open/read/write/unlink)
- Process behavior collection (execve/fork/ptrace)
- All data structures are simple C structs, compatible with libbpf

**Output Format:**
```c
struct event_net_conn {
  u64 timestamp;
  u32 pid;
  u32 uid;
  char comm[16];
  u32 saddr;
  u32 daddr;
  u16 sport;
  u16 dport;
};
```

---

### 2. `user_agent` - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Rust Daemon Process
> Responsible for loading eBPF programs, monitoring event ringbuffer, and executing rule-based threat analysis.

**Submodule Breakdown:**
- `ebpf_loader.rs`: Load/manage eBPF programs
- `event_parser.rs`: Event deserialization to Rust structs
- `rule_engine.rs`: Rule-based threat detection using heuristics
- `response.rs`: Security response module (alert, log, simulate blocking)
- `config.rs`: Configuration management

**Features:**
- Integration with `libbpf-rs` for eBPF loading
- Rule-based threat classification using predefined patterns
- Local event correlation and pattern matching
- Threat detection triggers event output in JSON format

---

### 3. `threat_detection` - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Rule-based Classification Module
> Uses heuristic rules and pattern matching for threat detection, demonstrating security analysis concepts.

**Input Format:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "net_conn",
  "pid": 1234,
  "process": "curl",
  "target_ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "target_port": 443,
  "timestamp": 172847183
}
```

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "label": "Suspicious Network Activity",
  "risk_score": 0.7,
  "detection_method": "rule_based",
  "recommendation": "monitor_process"
}
```

**Detection Methods:**
- Heuristic pattern matching
- File path analysis
- Process behavior analysis
- Network connection patterns

---

### 4. `web_ui` (📋 **CONCEPTUAL**) - Demo Dashboard
> Educational dashboard for viewing behavior events, rule-based classification results, and system metrics.

Recommended Tech Stack:
- Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- WebSocket for real-time event streaming
- Educational purpose only

---

## 🔌 Threat Detection Interface Specification

```rust
// Rule-based threat classification
pub fn classify_threat(event: &SecurityEvent) -> ThreatAnalysis {
    let mut risk_score = 0.0;
    
    // File path analysis
    if event.file_path.contains("/tmp/") {
        risk_score += 0.3;
    }
    
    // Process analysis
    if event.process_name.contains("sh") {
        risk_score += 0.4;
    }
    
    ThreatAnalysis {
        risk_score,
        method: "rule_based".to_string(),
        confidence: 0.8,
    }
}
```
